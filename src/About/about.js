                <p>Once I was a photographer. 
                </p>
                <p>Before that, I was a microbiologist.
                </p>
                <p>Now I explore the final frontier of full-stack web development.
                </p>
                <p>My speciality is MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node.js), but I'm always learning something
                    new. I love to making dreams a reality, every step of the way.
